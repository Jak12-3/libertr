## Introduction

### Review

  This is a manual for the modern liberty-seeker individual. Based on consensus, decentralization and rationality, it tries to describe realities and solutions for one's life.
  
### Assumptions

  + One undestands, seeks and appreaciates liberty
  + One believes in the modern excess of government
  + One is willing not to be complacent

### Considerations
  + As an early project, there might be unintended bias coming from early contributors. As it grows, we expect it to go away.
  + This project is currently focused on the reality of western countries(and affected countries). If it doesn't reflect your reality, feel free to fork it and make changes. In order to build a community around it, we'd appreciate to reference it to Libertr.
